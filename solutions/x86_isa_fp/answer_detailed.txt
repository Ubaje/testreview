1-2. Memorization. s stands for single precision (float in C),
   and d stands for double precision (double in C).

3. vmovss is for 4-byte quantities, so we moved the bytes 15 34
   36 78 to %xmm1, but because this machine is little-endian, they're
   read as 0x78363415.

4. Similar to 3, but now we have an 8-byte quantity. The value read in
   is 0x1024483978363415.

5. We first read in the integer value 15, and convert it to a floating
   point value in %xmm3. Then, we add it to itself, so our result should
   be 30 in floating point representation, which is 0x41F00000.
