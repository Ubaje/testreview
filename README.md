# Exam 2 Review

This is a set of review problems for the CS 429 F2021 class's second exam.
It covers everything learned in the middle third of the class, including structs, unions, x-86 architecture, and code generation strategies for various code forms.

# Overview

There are two self-explanatory directories contained in this repository.
The `problems` directory contains the practice problems, and the `solutions` directory contains documented solutions for each problem.
A file named `example_problem` in the problems directory will have a corresponding `example_problem-sol` in the solutions directory.

# Testing Your Answers

Obviously, it defeats the purpose of practicing if you immediately look at the solutions, so I've included a way to test them to know if your answer is correct or not, without seeing the actual solution, in case you want to try again.
Inside the problems directory, there's a file named `sol.txt`, where you can write your answers, and a python script named `check_correctness.py`, which you can invoke with ```python3 check_correctness.py``` in the terminal.
