Let %rdi = 0x1000, and let the address 0x1000 in
memory correspond to the bytes 15 34 36 78 39 48 24 10.
Consider the assembly code below:
    vmovss      (%rdi), %xmm1
    vmovsd      (%rdi), %xmm2
    movl        $15, %esi
    vcvtsi2ss   %esi, %xmm3, %xmm3
    vaddss      %xmm3, %xmm3, %xmm3

1. What does a floating point instruction ending in s signify?

2. What does a floating point instruction ending in d signify?

3. What is the resulting value in register %xmm1 (hex)?

4. What is the resulting value in register %xmm2 (hex)?

5. What is the resulting value in register %xmm3 (hex)?
