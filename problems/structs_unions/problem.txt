For 1-6, refer to struct_ex.h:

1. What is the byte alignment of the struct?

2. What is the total size of the struct?

3. What is the byte offset of the third field of the struct?

4. How many bytes of padding are required for this struct?

5. If we could rearrange the fields of the struct such that we
   minimized padding, what would the size of the struct be?

6. If we could rearrange the fields of the struct such that we
   minimized padding, what would the minimum padding be?

For 7-9, refer to union_ex.h:

7. What is the size of the union?

8. If we have the code:
   val_t val;
   val.a = 257;

   What is the value of val.c (in hex, removing any leading zeroes)?

9. If we have the code:
   val_t val;
   val.name = "CS429";

   What is the value of val.a (in hex, removing any leading zeroes)?
