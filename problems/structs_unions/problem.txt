For 1-5, refer to struct_ex.h:

1. What is the byte alignment of the struct?

2. What is the total size of the struct?

3. What is the byte offset of the third field of the struct?

4. How many bytes of padding are required for this struct?

5. If we could rearrange the fields of the struct such that we
   minimized padding, what would the minimum padding be?
   Note that the arrangement may not be unique, so you don't
   need to report it here.
