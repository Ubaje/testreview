No specific code is required for 1-3:

1. Which registers are used for passing arguments to a function?
   For automatically checking your answer, put your answer in the
   format: a, b, c, d, e, f
   (each separated by a comma and a space)

2. What register holds the return value of a function?

3. Is %rbx a caller-save or callee-save register?

For problems 4-9, refer to problem.s and problem.c, the C code
is missing some things, which you can find in the assembly code:

4. What is TYPE_A?

5. What is TYPE_B?

6. What is COND?

7. What is VAL_A?

8. What is VAL_B?

For 9-11, suppose we get the function call foo(7,3) from main(),
and no other functions are called before or after this one.

9. What value would the call return?

10. How many stack frames would be created in total?

11. What is the greatest depth we reach, in terms of stack frames?
   (i.e., main has a depth of 0, the initial foo call has a depth
   of 1, etc.)
