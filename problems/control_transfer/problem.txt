1. Which registers does a callq instruction update?

2. Which registers does a retq instruction update?

Suppose we were given the following assembly code. Let's say we know that before the execution of fun begins, %rsp stores 0x500.

	fun:
		pushq 0x5
		callq 0x1000	# Line 1
		callq foo	# Line 2
		ret

	0x1000:
		pushq 0x10
		cmpq %rip, 0x1000
		je .L1		# Line 3
		popq %rdx	# Line 4
		ret		# Line 5
	.L1:	
		pushq 0x15	
		ret		# Line 6		

	foo:
		popq %rax
		ret		# Line 7

	
3. What will be the value of %rsp before line 1 executes?

4. What will be the value of (%rsp) before line 1 executes?

5. What line number will be executed next after the instruction at line 3 is completed?

6. What will %rdx store after line 4 executes?

Now, suppose we know both the "callq 0x1000" and "callq foo" instructions on line 1 and 2 take up 5 bytes. The instruction on line 1 starts at address 0x1500.

7. What will be the value of %rsp before line 5 executes?

8. What will be the value of (%rsp) before line 5 executes?

9. What will be the value of %rip after line 5 executes?

10. What will be the value of %rsp before line 7 executes?

11. What will be the value of (%rsp) before line 7 executes?

12. What will be the value of %rip after line 7 executes? 

Let's say the jump on line 3 somehow succeeded, and we managed to get to label .L1 and begin executing the instructions it contains.

13. What would %rip store after line 6 executes?

14. What would %rsp store after line 6 executes?

15. What would (%rsp) store after line 6 executes?
