1. How many general-purpose registers are there?

2. For this class, most instructions use the syntax:
   <instruction>    <source>, <dest>
   What's this syntax called?

For 3-11, consider the assembly code:
   movq $5, %rdi
   xorl %rsi, %rsi
   addl $1, %rsi
   movq %rdi, %rdx
   shlq %rsi, %rdx
   movl $0x7FFFFFFF, %rcx
   addl %esi, %ecx
   leaq 0xC(%rdi, %rsi, 4), %r8

3. What's the resulting value of %rdi?

4. What's the resulting value of %rsi?

5. What's the resulting value of %rdx?

6. What's the resulting value of %rcx (in hex)?

7. What's the resulting value of %r8? 

8. What's the resulting value of ZF?

9. What's the resulting value of SF?

10. What's the resulting value of CF?

11. What's the resulting value of OF?

12. This isn't necessarily specific to the ISA, but
   what endianness is implied when we ask you to
   assume an x86 architecture?

13. What does an instruction ending in b signify?

14. What does an instruction ending in w signify?

15. What does an instruction ending in l signify?

16. What does an instruction ending in q signify?
