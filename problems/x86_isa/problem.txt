1. How many general-purpose registers are there?

2. For this class, most instructions use the syntax:
   <instruction>    <source>, <dest>
   What's this syntax called?

For 3-10, consider the assembly code:
   movq $5, %rdi
   xorq %rsi, %rsi
   addq $1, %rsi
   movq %rdi, %rdx
   shlq %rsi, %rdx
   movq 0x7FFFFFFF, %rcx
   addq %rsi, %rcx

3. What's the resulting value of %rdi?

4. What's the resulting value of %rsi?

5. What's the resulting value of %rdx?

6. What's the resulting value of %rcx (in hex)?

7. What's the resulting value of ZF?

8. What's the resulting value of SF?

9. What's the resulting value of CF?

10. What's the resulting value of OF?
